# Getting Started

The best way to learn something is to dive in and figure out if you can swim.
Or so I hear. In this section we have gathered a collection of guides to
get you up to speed fast. We will cover the topics in greater detail in
further chapters.

First look at the [Schema Docs](schema.md) to get your bearings.

Next we will go over [Rest Datasource](restdatasource.md) which will be useful
if you have REST api's that you wish to query with your GraphQL.

Then we will cover [Custom Resolvers](customresolvers.md) to use when you
are in the mood for all things custom.

Or if you are just impatient you can head to the [Deep End](deepend.md) where
we assume you know what you are doing. If not you can always go back.
